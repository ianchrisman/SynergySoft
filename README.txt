HOW TO RUN
Place the .java files, in a package called threadcount.  Compile and run in your IDE of choice.  We used both NetBeans and Eclipse while writing this code.  Recommend you download the latest versions so you have the most recent libraries available.

Netbeans: Once you’ve created a package and have the source code imported you will need to add the the MySQL JDBC Library.  While in Netbeans, click on the Projects tab, (this is usually on the left).  Under the ThreadCount project right click on Libraries folder and click “add Library”  Select MYSQL JDBC Driver.  You should be able to compile and run the source code now.

Justin can provide some instructions for Eclipse IDE if needed.
